# spring-boot-react-docker
This is a template project to initialize a Spring Boot backend with a React frontend.
The complete project is built as a multi-module Maven project. The modules (backend and frontend) can be built and run independently. For testing purposes, the project is dockerized (see the docker-compose.yml).
